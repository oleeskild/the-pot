## Developing

Installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`).

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# or start the server and make the app available on your network 

npm run dev --host
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
